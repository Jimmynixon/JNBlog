 </body>
  
 <p> Let us create an example of what we are trying to do here. Let's say that we want to find out the total distance of bike lanes in Berlin in Kilometers.</p>
 
 <p> <b> 1) Firstly download QGIS - </b> <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/"> Download QGIS </a> </p>

<p>What is QGIS did you say? - Here is the Wiki explanation ;) - <i> QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. </i> </p>

<p>This platform has some amazing tools that will make the task super easy for us. It will allow us to extract data from open street maps using the Overpass.api and then analyse it. 
</p>
 
 <p> <b> 2) Download Plug in called QuickOSM </b> </p> 
 
 <p style="background-color:tomato;> After installing QGIS, start up the program and find the drop down called "Plugins".  Click "Manage and Install Plugins"  and then in the Plugins window that pops up there will be a search bar where we will search for "QuickOSM" and install it. </p>
